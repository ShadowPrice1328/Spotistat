## How to use it?
You can use the release version right away, but if you want to run this program via Visual Studio, you have to set the value of "base64".\
Where and how to get it? 
1) Go to [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
2) Create an app
3) Find "Client ID" and "Client Secret" values there
4) Connect them with ":" like this: client_id:client_secret
5) Encode this string to base4 format [here](https://www.base64encode.org/)
